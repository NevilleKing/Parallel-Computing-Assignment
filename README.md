A parallel weather statistic program written in C++ with OpenCL. Submitted for the 3rd year Parallel Computing module
at the University of Lincoln.

## Installation
The easiest way to install is download the executable on the 
[Releases page](https://github.com/NevilleKing/Parallel-Computing-Assignment/releases/latest).

You can also run the sln file. You will need run-time drivers to run the code. These are usaully included with AMD and NVidia GPU's
but you may need to install them if you are running on CPU. This program also uses the Intel SDK for OpenCL Applications found
[here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-opencl).
